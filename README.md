Project made for my Engineering Thesis focusing on the utilization of the MVC pattern in a database program.
An application allowing users to check fuel prices entered by other users.
Using the official list of Polish fuel stations
Data filtering based on location.
Station search functionality.
Station coordinates created using Google Maps API and Python script.
Connection to a database storing information about stations and their prices.
Price editing and station removal functions.

To run the app we need to access the DB with connection string in VS, then we need to run the app from there using button and to run the site we need to use command ng serve preferably in VSC
