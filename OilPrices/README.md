# OilPrices

A fullstack app made for my Engineer's Thesis about usage of MVC in projects. 
It allows users to enter prices of fuel available on fuel stations across Poland. 
Backend was made in ASP .NET 7 with an use of a python script (Google Maps API) to generate coordinates of each station in DB based on their adress. 
The view part (frontend) was made in Angular 17 using bootstrap. 
Design based on YT tutorial about CRUDs.

Currently working on a map with markers of each station based on the coordinates.
The old version of the project is in a second branch.
